In this figure I apply 200 Gt/yr signal to Greenland, apply random Gaussian
noise with covariance matching that of the signal, and then recover Greenland.
I do not use any corrections (GIA, Elastic Response, Solid Earth, etc.).
Ellsemere Island is not accounted for.  Data spans 17 April 2002 - 26 Nov 2016.
