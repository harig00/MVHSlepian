In this figure I recover Iceland from the real GRACE data for Greenland.
The figure is in Gt/yr, not % recovered, since I do not know what the divisor
should be in any percent calculation (in other words, I'm not sure out of what
to calculate the percentage).
I do not use any corrections (GIA, Elastic Response, Solid Earth, etc.).
Ellsemere Island is not accounted for.  Data spans April 2002 - June 2017.
