In this figure I recover Greenland from the real GRACE data for Greenland.
The figure is in Gt/yr.  That said, it is probably wrong - I think I am not dividing by something (maybe surface area of the earth or something like that) which I am supposed to be dividing by.  So I suspect the pattern is write but the numbers are probably way off right now.
should be in any percent calculation (in other words, I'm not sure out of what
to calculate the percentage).
I use the Paulson07 correction for GIA.
Ellsemere Island is not accounted for.  Data spans April 2002 - December 2016.
