========== CORRECTIONS ==========
* GIA (TODO)
* Instantaneous Elastic Response (TODO)
	- Description: This is the change in gravity in response to elastic changes
				in the earth over time caused mostly by the cooling of the 
				Little Ice Age, although also partially by other climatic 
				events.
	- Reference: See 10.1046/j.1365-246x.2001.01442.x in references.txt
	- Question: Do we have a way to do this for anything other than Greenland?
				The paper seems Greenland specific - do models exist elsewhere, 
				and if so, where can I find them?
	- Question: Do I need to apply the phenomenon I am correcting for, and then
				correct for it (basically do and undo the effect) in order to 
				truly simulate having a boxcap 200 Gt/yr mass loss trend over 
				the region?  If so, how do I do this realistically, without 
				clearly circular logic?
* Solid Earth (TODO)

============= TESTS =============
In all tests below I use 200Gt/yr synthetic noise
