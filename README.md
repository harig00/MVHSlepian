**MVHSLEPIAN** is my working directory of code for the SLEPIAN project.
The code and figures in this repository are primarily for my own research purposes, although some of the scripts I develop do/will eventually make their way into official SLEPIAN repositories (Alpha, Delta, etc.).

**Fall17** contains my work over the semester of Fall 2017, and, predictably, **Spring18** contains my work over the semester of Spring 2018.  The former is unorganized and poorly documented; the latter is organized and well documented.

I am focusing my UA NASA Space Grant Internship research on synthetic experiments, and so the majority of the useful code in this repository concerns creating various sorts of synthetic data, conducting experiments on that data, and graphically representing the results of those experiments.

I can be reached with questions/concerns via [email](mailto:maxvonhippel@email.arizona.edu) or through the GitHub issue tracker on this project.
